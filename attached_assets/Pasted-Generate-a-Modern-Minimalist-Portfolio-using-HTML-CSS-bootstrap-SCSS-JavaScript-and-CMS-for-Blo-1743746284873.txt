Generate a Modern, Minimalist Portfolio using HTML, CSS (bootstrap/SCSS), JavaScript and CMS for Blogs: Medium API integration...

WebsiteObjective:Create a modern, minimalistic, and professional portfolio website for a computer science engineer specializing in AI, deep learning, system programming, compiler engineering, and GPU computing. The website should have a sleek, black-and-white theme with subtle abstract line patterns in the background, smooth animations, and a clean UI. The design should be responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Design Requirements:Minimalistic & Modern UI with a black-and-white color scheme.Abstract, smooth line patterns in the background to enhance aesthetics.Responsive Design (mobile-friendly).Smooth scrolling & animated section transitions.Dark mode as default, with an option to toggle light mode.Typography: Use clean, modern fonts like Poppins or Montserrat.(for Developers)
